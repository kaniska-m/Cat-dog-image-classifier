This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# Key Features:
This repository showcases a Flutter application that leverages TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for image classification of cats and dogs.

## Flutter Framework: 
Builds a user-friendly and interactive mobile app interface.
## TensorFlow Lite (TFLite): 
Enables on-device image classification using a pre-trained machine learning model, ensuring faster processing and potentially improved privacy.
## Virtual Emulator Support: 
Facilitates convenient testing and development on your computer without requiring a physical device.
## Cat vs. Dog Classification:
Classifies images captured by the device's camera, displaying the results within the app.
